# My Snipmate scripts

I love (Snipmate)[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540] and discovered there are changes I'd like to make. So I built my own repo here to back it up.

example:
```bash
cd ~/repo
git clone git@github.com:jjasghar/snipmate-snippets.git
cd ~/.vim/snippets
ln -s ~/repo/snipmate-snippets/snippets/chef.snippets ./
```
